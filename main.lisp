mktrampline creates a ‚Äútrampoline‚Äù application launcher that immediately
launches another application.

sync-dock updates persistent items in your dock if any of the given apps has the
same name. This can be used to programmatically keep pinned items in your dock
up to date with potential new versions of an app outside of the /Applications
directory, without having to check which one is pinned etc.

sync-trampolines is an all-in-1 solution that syncs an entire directory of *.app
files to another by creating a trampoline launcher for every app, deleting the
rest, and updating the dock.
